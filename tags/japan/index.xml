      <title>Winter Sounds in Japan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of uniquely Japanese sounds.  But the two I&amp;rsquo;m writing
about today appear on cold winter nights, and echo eerily through the
dark, empty streets between dinner and bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ride to Okutama-ko and back</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1qLR0za_apX5qMJi32cqDoNYESRI&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;ll=35.67441532772013%2C139.44887900000003&amp;amp;spn=0.214689%2C0.47083&amp;amp;t=p&amp;amp;source=embed&amp;amp;z=9&#34;&gt;View map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t ridden a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_ride&#34;&gt;century&lt;/a&gt; since I moved to Japan but with a bit of
spare time on my hands before baby number two is due, I decided I was going to
get back into decent enough shape that I could pull one off. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using
mornings and weekends to get back into riding longer distances, and slowly
building up toward the goal of 160 km by riding further and further up the Tama
river every weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monkey Madness</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many police does it take to catch a monkey in one of Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s busiest train
stations? Apparently a lot more than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=1LbhEJ2NUxE&#34;&gt;40 or so that
tried&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple Reinvents the Phone?</title>
      <link>https://chris.bracken.jp/2007/01/apple-reinvents-the-iphone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (2009-02-28)&lt;/em&gt;: Alright, guilty as charged. &amp;ldquo;No wireless. Less space
than a nomad.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/Apple-releases-iPod&#34;&gt;Lame&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the Steve Jobs iPhone keynote, I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m a little
disappointed. While this phone has a slicker GUI than any other phone I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen, it&amp;rsquo;s not so much the $499 US price-tag, but the stone-age functionality
of the phone compared to what we have here in Japan that makes my jaw
drop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Mystery Solved</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest complaints about Japan has always been the complete and utter
lack of garbage bins in this city. There are none to be found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canadians in Tokyo got a head start on the Canada Day celebrations, kicking
things off at 8:30 am with a pancake breakfast at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maplesportsbar.jp/&#34;&gt;Maple Leaf Bar &amp;amp;
Grill&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a Canada Day barbeque at Yoyogi Park including
hot dogs, yakitori, a massive Canadian Flag cake, and imported Canadian beer.
By 6pm things, as started to wind down at the park, people started the long
trek back to Shibuya and into the Maple Leaf, where it was standing room
only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my first trip to the dentist in years. The last time was just
before moving to Mexico, in the summer of 2001. As you might imagine, I was not
entirely expecting a clean bill of dental health. The fact that I had once
again ignored my dentist&amp;rsquo;s advice to floss daily was not improving my outlook
one bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The big news is that Yasuko and I will be getting married in November at
Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto. For the desperately curious, I &amp;lsquo;officially&amp;rsquo; proposed
in February at &lt;em&gt;Souvenir&lt;/em&gt;, a French restaurant down the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, the temperature shot up to 23 degrees, and in the space of two
days, the cherry blossom trees erupted into bloom. The Japanese take this
opportunity to throw impromptu picnics, dinners, and random sake-drinking
events under &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom&#34;&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt; trees all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I stared blankly out the window of the train on my morning commute,
something caught my eye. As the train flew along its raised track, whizzing
past the rooftops of Gakugei-daigaku at 80 km/h, I swear I saw a guy
standing on the roof of a building alongside the track, dressed in a red cape
and wearing a giant fish on his head, wailing away on a guitar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;今年も宜しくお願いします！Jumped on the Nozomi Shinkansen from Shin-Yokohama
station on the 31st to arrive in Kyoto two hours later. It was dumping snow
from Nagoya onwards; and by the time we hit Kyoto, about 10 cm had
accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I came into work to a nice surprise this morning. Sipping on hot green tea, we
all crowded around the windows to check out the view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the last days of 2004 upon us, it appears the weather has taken a turn
from the relative warmth of November and December to plummet sub-zero
overnight. What started as a light flurry this morning has progressed to a
full-out blizzard, and it’s still coming down like crazy as I write
this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Through a stroke of luck, I think I may have actually found a permanent place
to live in Jiyugaoka close to Toritsu Daigaku station.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After two years back in Canada and several trips back and forth to Japan, I’ve signed a full-time contract as a software developer with a firm in Tokyo and am permanently re-locating to Japan. I’ll post pictures as soon as I can get around to it.</description>

      <title>Summer 2004 in Japan</title>
      <link>https://chris.bracken.jp/2004/08/summer-2004-in-japan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned my summer vacations for May, then July, and finally,
in an effort to match my summer vacations with those of friends in Japan, ended
up shuffling them back to August. Aside from the scorching heat, August is a
fantastic time of year to visit. The heat this summer was more than a little
bit scorching though, it was the hottest summer in ten years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Biking Japan 2003</title>

         alt=&#34;Brodie bike parked beside vending machines in front of restaurant&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to travel from Osaka north to the Japan Sea, northeast along the
coast to Joetsu, south through the alps to Nagano, then southeast all the way
to Tokyo — a total distance of close to 1200 km, entirely by bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
