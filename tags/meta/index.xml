      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to think that the things I create have a whole ton of value, but I do think it&amp;rsquo;s important to carefully consider the terms under which they&amp;rsquo;re shared to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re consistent with my values. Despite my general dislike for all things legalistic, the most unambiguous way to state those terms is through a licence. So a couple days ago, I tossed LICENSE files into any of my public repos that didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I moved my webpage and was all of a sudden faced with a deluge of emails
from people who I never even knew read the thing. Among those emails was a
request from my amigo Chaffee requesting more pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I finally got around to updating and re-organizing the site. It should render properly in everything from the latest browser to lynx or a text-based browser on a cell phone. All the reports from MÃ©rida are now up, including links to photos at the top of each page. The trip home is still a work in progress.</description>
