26 December 2001
<p>Somewhere on the old highway between Cancún and Mérida lies Chichen Itzá. The
ruins at this site cover over 15 square kilometres, with <em>El Castillo</em> alone
taking up 0.4 hectares. At 83 metres in length, the Ball Court is the largest
in Meso-America. The close proximity of the ruins to Cancún and the size of
some of the structures have made these the most famous Mayan ruins in the
country.</p>

<p>The image that most people associate with Chichen Itzá is <em>El Castillo</em>. The
pyramid rises more than 23 metres above the ground, with steep staircases up
all four sides, leading to a small building at the top. What’s so spectacular
about it is the fact that this pyramid is actually a huge Mayan calendar built
of stone.  The four staircases leading to the top have 91 steps each, which
when added to the platform at the top, make 365. On the sides are 52 panels
representing the 52 years of the traditional Mayan calendar round. The pyramid
is composed of nine terraced platforms on either side of the two primary
staircases, for a total of 18, the number of months in the Mayan calendar. If
you’re still not convinced of the Mayans’ astronomical prowess, you can easily
convince yourself by visiting on either the spring or the fall equinox when, as
the sun rises over the jungle, the form of a giant serpent is projected onto
the sides of the two primary staircases, each of which has a giant stone
serpent head at its base. This illusion is created by the precise alignment of
the terraces in relation to position of the sun.</p>
<p>In a corner in the shade of one of the giant staircases leading up the side of
El Castillo is a door. Once or twice a day, the door is opened, and groups of
20 or so are allowed inside. A narrow passage leads to a steep staircase that
runs up the side of another pyramid inside El Castillo. It’s narrow, cramped,
hot and humid, not to mention dark, but the climb is worth it. Eventually, at
the top of the staircase, if you’re lucky or pushy enough, you can catch a
glimpse of a jewel-encrusted jaguar altar, used by the Maya for sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Ball Court is another feat of engineering. The walls are each approximately
8 metres high, with structures at the top for viewing the game. At either end
of the court is an elaborate stone temple. But what is so amazing about the
Ball Court is its acoustics. A whisper at one end can be clearly heard at the
other end, 135 metres away. In fact, the sound reflection at the centre of the
court is so incredible, you can hear at least nine echos if you clap or shout.</p>
<p>The following excerpt, by one of the supervising archaeologists restoring the
ruins, describes the acoustics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chi cheen Itsa’s famous &lsquo;Ball-court&rsquo; or Temple of the Maize cult offers the
visitor besides its mystery and impressive architecture, its marvellous
acoustics If a person standing under either ring claps his hands or yells, the
sound produced will be repeated several times gradually losing its volume, A
single revolver shot seems machine-gun fire. The sound waves travel with equal
force to East or West, day or night. disregarding the wind’s direction. Anyone
speaking in a normal voice from the &lsquo;Forum&rsquo; can be clearly heard in the &lsquo;Sacred
Tribune&rsquo; five hundred feet away or vice-versa. If a short sentence, for
example, &lsquo;Do you hear me?&rsquo; is pronounced it will be repeated word by word&hellip;
Parties from one extreme to the other can hold a conversation without raising
their voices.</p>
<p>This transmission of sound, as yet unexplained, has been discussed by
architects and archaeologists &hellip; Most of them used to consider it as fanciful
due to the ruined conditions of the structure but, on the contrary, we who have
engaged in its reconstruction know well that the sound volume, instead of
disappearing, has become stronger and clearer&hellip; Undoubtedly we must consider
this feat of acoustics as another noteworthy achievement of engineering
realized millenniums ago by the Maya technicians.</p>
<p><em>—Chi Cheen Itza by Manuel Cirerol Sansores, 1947</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aside from the Ball Court and <em>El Castillo</em>, there are dozens of other sites of
interest. There are no less than three cenotes around the site, one of which
was filled with tens of thousands of artifacts, from neclaces and jewelry to
the bones of human and animal sacrifices. The Hall of the Thousand Pillars is
also incredible to walk through, with each pillar featuring unique carvings and
inscriptions; on some, traces of red and blue paint are still visible.</p>
<p>The site was originally populated by the Itzáes around 500 AD, and slowly built
up until 900 AD, at which point it was completely abandonned. No one knows why
the Itzáes left so abruptly, but it appears that the city was re-populated
about 100 years later, and then attacked by the Toltecs, a tribe known for its
brutality at war. Structures from the period between 1000 and 1300 AD show
marked Toltec influences, including numeral reliefs of Toltec gods, including
Quetzalcoatl, the plumed serpent. The city was abandonned once again around
1300, this time permanently.</p></article>
