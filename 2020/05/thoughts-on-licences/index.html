<h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://chris.bracken.jp/2020/05/thoughts-on-licences/">Thoughts on Licences</a></h2>
22 May 2020
<p>I don&rsquo;t pretend to think that the things I create have a whole ton of
value, but I do think it&rsquo;s important to carefully consider the terms
under which they&rsquo;re shared to ensure they&rsquo;re consistent with my values.
Despite my general dislike for all things legalistic, the most
unambiguous way to state those terms is through a licence. So a couple
days ago, I tossed LICENSE files into any of my public <a href="/code">repos</a>
that didn&rsquo;t already have one.</p>
<p>So how did I settle on which licences to apply? Jump on into the
DeLorean and let&rsquo;s set the dial back to the late 1980s.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 1986 and I&rsquo;ve got a 1200 baud modem wired up to a beat-up 286 with
a steel case that would easily allow it to double as a boat anchor if
needed.  Armed with a dot-matrix printout of local BBSes with names like
Camelot, Tommy&rsquo;s Holiday Camp, and Forbidden Night Castle, I fire up
PC-Talk. A series of <a href="https://www.windytan.com/2012/11/the-sound-of-dialup-pictured.html">high-pitched squeals and tones</a>
fill the air, then text flashes across the screen. I&rsquo;m online.</p>
<p>BBSes were a treasure trove of information, filled to the brim with zip
archives full of downloadable programs, source code, patches for
existing programs, and all manner of text files with names like
<a href="https://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html">Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit</a>. You could find
everything from how to crack copy-protected software, to details on
phone phreaking, to how to make nitroglycerine from commonly-available
household items. It was through BBSes that I first downloaded an I&rsquo;m
sure <em>totally legitimate</em> copy of Borland Turbo C++ and took my first
baby steps writing <em>real</em> programs. No more BASIC for me.</p>
<p>This culture of open sharing in the online world has had a huge impact
on me. From those early experiences with BBSes to my first forays onto
the Internet a few years later, seeing people openly sharing code and
patches and helping each other solve problems over Usenet seemed almost
revolutionary to me at the time. In some ways, it still does. I feel
lucky to have been a part of it from such an early age.</p>
<p>The end result is that I try to publicly share all the work I do. So
when it came time to chuck licences on stuff, I sat down to work out a
personals ad for my ideal licence. Aside from enjoying long walks on the
beach, it should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allow free use, modification, and distribution both of the original
work and any derived works.</li>
<li>Require that people distributing the work or any derived work to
give appropriate credit.</li>
<li>Disallow suggesting that I in any way endorse any derived products
or whoever produces them.</li>
<li>Gently encourage a culture of open exchange and sharing of
information and techniques.</li>
<li>Be short, clear, and easy to understand.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the software side, there were lots of options, but the best matches
in my mind are the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT</a> or <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD</a> licences.
The 3-clause &lsquo;new&rsquo; BSD licence has an advantage in that it required
written permission from the author to use their name in any
endorsement/promotion of a derived work. That happens to be what we
already use for <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter">work</a>.</p>
<p>On the content side, I&rsquo;ve always posted my web site&rsquo;s content under a
<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike</a> licence.  But I don&rsquo;t
believe that&rsquo;s actually the ideal match based on my priorities. Why is
it that I&rsquo;ve elected to use a licence that requires that derived works
also be licensed under the same terms rather than under whatever terms
someone feels like, so long as credit is given? In the end I settled on
the more permissive <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> licence.</p>
<p>This feels to me a bit like the difference between <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD</a>
and <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0">GPL</a> terms, where the latter requires that derived
works also be GPL-licensed. This &ldquo;viral&rdquo; nature has always rubbed me the
wrong way: rather than gently promoting a culture of sharing by example,
it legally <em>requires</em> sharing under the same terms whether or not you
want to.</p>
<p>Personally, I&rsquo;d like for people to do the right thing and share their
work for everyone&rsquo;s benefit not because they <em>have</em> to, but because they
<em>want</em> to. If they don&rsquo;t want to, why should my reaction be to disallow
their use of my work? Isn&rsquo;t that contrary to my stated goals of sharing
as much and as broadly as possible?</p>
<p>While I <em>hope</em> that more people share more of their work, it doesn&rsquo;t
bother me if you don&rsquo;t. If anything I&rsquo;ve written is somehow useful to
you, I&rsquo;m glad. Use your knowledge to help others and make the world a
better place, and if you can find time to do so, share a bit with the
rest of us.</p>
