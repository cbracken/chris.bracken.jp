10 May 2011
<p>A big difference between the last time I moved to the US and this time is that
this time, I&rsquo;ve got a lot more stuff. One of those things is a recent-vintage
Nissan. Faced with the prospect of selling my car and buying a new one, I chose
instead to import the one I know and love. Here is my story. But be
forewarned, it is not for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>To import a vehicle to the US from Canada, you need to undertake a series of
quests. These are detailed on the <a href="http://stnw.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/">NHTSA website</a> under the heading
<em>Vehicle Importation Guidelines (Canadian)</em>. As of May 2011, you need the
following items in increasing order of difficulty:</p>
<p><strong>[easy]</strong> The following information about your car:</p>
<ol>
<li>VIN</li>
<li>Make/Model/Year</li>
<li>Month/Year of manufacture</li>
<li>Registration &amp; ownership information</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>[easy]</strong> <a href="http://www.epa.gov/oms/imports/">EPA Form 3520-1</a>. You will likely be importing your
vehicle under <em>code EE: identical in all material respects to a US certified
version</em>.</p>
<p><strong>[easy]</strong> <a href="http://www.nhtsa.gov/cars/rules/import/">NHTSA Form HS-7</a>. You will most likely be importing your
vehicle under box 2B, for vehicles that complied with Canadian CMVSA
regulations at their time of manufacture and where the manufacturer attests
that, with a few exceptions, it meets US regulations; see final item.</p>
<p><strong>[medium]</strong> A letter on the manufacturer&rsquo;s letterhead from the Canadian
distributor, stating that there are no open recalls or service campaigns on the
vehicle. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is required, but Nissan Canada thought it would
be.</p>
<p><strong>[hard]</strong> A letter from the vehicle’s original manufacturer, on
the manufacturer’s letterhead identifying the vehicle by vehicle identification
number (VIN) and stating that the vehicle conforms to all applicable FMVSS
&ldquo;except for the labeling requirements of Standards Nos. 101 <em>Controls and
Displays</em> and 110 <em>Tire Selection and Rims</em> or 120 <em>Tire Selection and Rims for
Motor Vehicles other than Passenger Cars</em>, and/or the specifications of
Standard No. 108 <em>Lamps, Reflective Devices, and Associated Equipment</em>,
relating to daytime running lamps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Items 1-3 are left as an exercise to the reader. I will focus here on items 4
and 5 to save you the 14 hours of accumulated hold time and multiple phone
calls. Prepare yourself friend, for here begins a journey of hurt and
frustration, but you will prevail.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with item 4. I gave <a href="http://www.nissan.ca/common/footer/en/contact.html">Nissan Canada</a> a ring at
1-800-387-0122 and managed to make it through the phone navigation system to a
human operator. I told them I was importing a Canadian Nissan into the States
and needed a <em>Letter of Compliance</em>. After a bit of digging, they stated that
such letters are only provided by <em>Nissan North America,</em> but they would
instead mail out two other letters on Nissan letterhead:</p>
<ol>
<li>A letter stating the VIN and that the vehicle has no pending recalls or
service campaigns on it.</li>
<li>In place of a <em>Certificate of Origin</em> (which Nissan Canada does not
provide), a letter stating the VIN and that the vehicle was manufactured for
sale in the Canadian market and complied with all safety and emission
regulations at the time of manufacture.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&rsquo;re almost there, but your next and final mission is also the most
challenging: the <em>Letter of Compliance</em>. Call <a href="http://www.nissanusa.com/apps/contactus">Nissan North
America</a> Consumer Affairs Department at 1-800-647-7261. Navigate
through the phone system to an operator - get their name and extension. They
may ask for your VIN only to find it&rsquo;s not in their system. Canadian VINs are
not in their system. Some operators thought they were, others were sure they
weren&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re not. Many operators tried and failed to find it. Ask them to
open a file, give them the vehicle information and your info and get the file
number. Use this number whenever you call.</p>
<p>Here are the five steps to success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell the operator that you&rsquo;re importing a Canadian Nissan vehicle to the US
and that you need a <em>Letter of Compliance</em> stating the VIN and that the
vehicle was built to conform to Canadian and United States EPA emissions
standards and all US Federal motor vehicle standards except for daytime
running light brightness. There is a very good chance they&rsquo;ve never heard of
this. Get them to talk to their supervisor, and their supervisor. Anyone.
Someone will know.</li>
<li>They will tell you that the vehicle needs to have its daytime running lights
disabled before they will issue the letter of compliance. All the government
rules seem to specifically exclude the daytime running lights, and the
letter they issue even states that the vehicle doesn&rsquo;t meet that standard,
but for whatever reason they want a copy of a work statement showing the
work was done. Remember to get the operator&rsquo;s name and extension and the
fax number for the work statement before you hang up.</li>
<li>Get the daytime running lights disabled. It&rsquo;s a setting change in the
on-board computer; your local dealer will do this in under 30 mins for $50
or so. </li>
<li>Fax your the work statement and put your name, return fax number and a
request for the <em>Letter of Compliance</em> on the cover sheet. Phone Nissan
North America Consumer Affairs back. The phone navigation system will give
you hope that you can input an extension directly, only to find it only
accepts 5-digit extensions but your rep has a 6-digit extension. You&rsquo;ll end
up back in the queue. Ask whoever you get to put you through to your
previous rep, by extension. When you get through, say that you sent the fax
and request the letter. Ask them to phone you back when they&rsquo;ve faxed it.</li>
<li>You&rsquo;ll get the fax eventually - <em>check the information!</em> On my letter, the
year, model and VIN were all incorrect, though they got my name right. If
it&rsquo;s incorrect, try again.</li>
</ol>
<p>You now have everything you need to import your Nissan to the States. Good
luck my friends, I don&rsquo;t envy you, but know that I am with you and that victory
will someday be yours too.</p></article>
