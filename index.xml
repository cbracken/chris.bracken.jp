      <title>Thoughts on Licences</title>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to think that the things I create have a whole ton of value, but I do think it&amp;rsquo;s important to carefully consider the terms under which they&amp;rsquo;re shared to ensure they&amp;rsquo;re consistent with my values. Despite my general dislike for all things legalistic, the most unambiguous way to state those terms is through a licence. So a couple days ago, I tossed LICENSE files into any of my public repos that didn&amp;rsquo;t already have one.</description>

      <title>Hand-decoding an ELF binary image</title>
      <link>https://chris.bracken.jp/2018/10/decoding-an-elf-binary/</link>

      <guid>https://chris.bracken.jp/2018/10/decoding-an-elf-binary/</guid>
      <description>While recovering from some dentistry the other day I figured I&amp;rsquo;d have a go at better understanding the ELF binary format. What better way to do that than to compile a small program and hand-decode the resulting binary with a hex editor and whatever ELF format spec I could find.
Overview Below, we&amp;rsquo;ll use nasm to build a small assembly Hello World program to a 64-bit ELF object file, then link that into an ELF executable with GNU ld.</description>

      <title>Moving to the US: Importing a Canadian Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://chris.bracken.jp/2011/05/moving-to-us-letter-of-compliance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big difference between the last time I moved to the US and this time is that
this time, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot more stuff. One of those things is a recent-vintage
Nissan. Faced with the prospect of selling my car and buying a new one, I chose
instead to import the one I know and love. Here is my story. But be
forewarned, it is not for the faint of heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Winter Sounds in Japan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of uniquely Japanese sounds.  But the two I&amp;rsquo;m writing
about today appear on cold winter nights, and echo eerily through the
dark, empty streets between dinner and bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Installing Mozc on Ubuntu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a Japanese speaker, one of the first things you do when you install a
fresh Linux distribution is to install a decent &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_IME&#34;&gt;Japanese IME&lt;/a&gt;.
Ubuntu defaults to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sourceforge.jp/projects/anthy/news/&#34;&gt;Anthy&lt;/a&gt;, but I personally prefer &lt;a href=&#34;https://code.google.com/p/mozc/&#34;&gt;Mozc&lt;/a&gt;, and
that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how to install here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t ridden a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_ride&#34;&gt;century&lt;/a&gt; since I moved to Japan but with a bit of
spare time on my hands before baby number two is due, I decided I was going to
get back into decent enough shape that I could pull one off. I&amp;rsquo;ve been using
mornings and weekends to get back into riding longer distances, and slowly
building up toward the goal of 160 km by riding further and further up the Tama
river every weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many police does it take to catch a monkey in one of Tokyo&amp;rsquo;s busiest train
stations? Apparently a lot more than the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jp.youtube.com/watch?v=1LbhEJ2NUxE&#34;&gt;40 or so that
tried&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href=&#34;http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/06/0028246&#34;&gt;Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;, this month the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II&#34;&gt;Apple
II&lt;/a&gt; turns 30. It was in production for 18 of those 30 years,
which likely makes it the longest-selling personal computer of all time. It was
the computer I wrote my first program on, and spent countless hours banging in
and editing code from &lt;em&gt;Compute&lt;/em&gt; magazine—including page after page of raw hex
code when a program included graphics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of &lt;a href=&#34;http://inessential.com/&#34;&gt;Brent Simmons&#39;&lt;/a&gt; OS X-based feed
reader, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/&#34;&gt;NetNewsWire&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a fantastic application, and I&amp;rsquo;ve definitely
got my money&amp;rsquo;s worth out of it. After partnering with &lt;a href=&#34;http://newsgator.com/&#34;&gt;NewsGator&lt;/a&gt;, I
started using their online feed-reader on and off, with mixed
results. I like that it keeps my feeds in sync between my computers,
and that I can browse articles at lunch, but the interface is still not on par
with NetNewsWire itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Apple Reinvents the Phone?</title>
      <link>https://chris.bracken.jp/2007/01/apple-reinvents-the-iphone/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (2009-02-28)&lt;/em&gt;: Alright, guilty as charged. &amp;ldquo;No wireless. Less space
than a nomad.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/Apple-releases-iPod&#34;&gt;Lame&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching the Steve Jobs iPhone keynote, I have to say I&amp;rsquo;m a little
disappointed. While this phone has a slicker GUI than any other phone I&amp;rsquo;ve
seen, it&amp;rsquo;s not so much the $499 US price-tag, but the stone-age functionality
of the phone compared to what we have here in Japan that makes my jaw
drop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest complaints about Japan has always been the complete and utter
lack of garbage bins in this city. There are none to be found.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Canadians in Tokyo got a head start on the Canada Day celebrations, kicking
things off at 8:30 am with a pancake breakfast at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maplesportsbar.jp/&#34;&gt;Maple Leaf Bar &amp;amp;
Grill&lt;/a&gt;, followed by a Canada Day barbeque at Yoyogi Park including
hot dogs, yakitori, a massive Canadian Flag cake, and imported Canadian beer.
By 6pm things, as started to wind down at the park, people started the long
trek back to Shibuya and into the Maple Leaf, where it was standing room
only.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t let anyone tell you that Canada never contributed groundbreaking research to the medical field. First, the discovery and isolation of insulin by researchers at the University of Toronto; now this paper published in the British Medical Journal, co-authored by a Grade 8 student from Hamilton, Ontario.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was my first trip to the dentist in years. The last time was just
before moving to Mexico, in the summer of 2001. As you might imagine, I was not
entirely expecting a clean bill of dental health. The fact that I had once
again ignored my dentist&amp;rsquo;s advice to floss daily was not improving my outlook
one bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

from people who I never even knew read the thing. Among those emails was a
request from my amigo Chaffee requesting more pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The big news is that Yasuko and I will be getting married in November at
Shimogamo Shrine in Kyoto. For the desperately curious, I &amp;lsquo;officially&amp;rsquo; proposed
in February at &lt;em&gt;Souvenir&lt;/em&gt;, a French restaurant down the street.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Just how far can you travel in a week and a half? It turns out pretty far. Combining planes, trains, ships, and automobiles, Yasuko and I travelled, all told, roughly 22,100 km over the Golden Week holiday.
From Tokyo to Avignon, on to Marseille, then Arles and Nîmes, followed by Carcassonne, Perpignan, and Barcelona, before heading back to Paris and home to Tokyo in 12 days wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad… Especially considering the car was a Fiat.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, the temperature shot up to 23 degrees, and in the space of two
days, the cherry blossom trees erupted into bloom. The Japanese take this
opportunity to throw impromptu picnics, dinners, and random sake-drinking
events under &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_blossom&#34;&gt;sakura&lt;/a&gt; trees all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I stared blankly out the window of the train on my morning commute,
something caught my eye. As the train flew along its raised track, whizzing
past the rooftops of Gakugei-daigaku at 80 km/h, I swear I saw a guy
standing on the roof of a building alongside the track, dressed in a red cape
and wearing a giant fish on his head, wailing away on a guitar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the last days of 2004 upon us, it appears the weather has taken a turn
from the relative warmth of November and December to plummet sub-zero
overnight. What started as a light flurry this morning has progressed to a
full-out blizzard, and it’s still coming down like crazy as I write
this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had originally planned my summer vacations for May, then July, and finally,
in an effort to match my summer vacations with those of friends in Japan, ended
up shuffling them back to August. Aside from the scorching heat, August is a
fantastic time of year to visit. The heat this summer was more than a little
bit scorching though, it was the hottest summer in ten years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Two last ski trips for the year. The first, at Mt. Washington, saw a beautiful attempt at a forward flip by Kevin, and Pippa ripping it up. For the second, I burned off on the 10 hour trek to Nelson, where Trav skiied until he dropped and I tried out the new Rossignol B2s.</description>

      <description>Put a group of idiots together on skis and boards, and you’ve got a guaranteed recipe for a good time. Tom managed a sweet 360 and Matt successfully pulled off half a backflip.</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to travel from Osaka north to the Japan Sea, northeast along the
coast to Joetsu, south through the alps to Nagano, then southeast all the way
to Tokyo — a total distance of close to 1200 km, entirely by bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

All the reports from Mérida are now up, including links to photos at the top of each page. The trip home is still a work in progress.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we stepped off the Cubana Ilyushin Il-62 plane at the Cancun airport, I
literally kissed the ground in happiness. The airport was crowded with people
snacking on good Mexican food and the sound of shouting and laughter filled the
air. After all the episodes of trouble, dengue fever, and trying to figure out
what the hell was actually going on, it was easy to lose sight of just how
great a country México is, and after Cuba, coming back to México felt like
coming home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Looking down on the ocean from the rolling hills a kilometre away, Trinidad is
a small, traditional town whose population of 50,000 takes great pride in its
home. Founded by Diego Velásquez in 1514, Trinidad became a stopover for
explorers and trading ships travelling to and from México. During the 17th and
18th centuries, its economy largely depended on trading contraband with
pirates. The buildings are in incredibly good shape for their age, most of
which are at least two centuries old. It’s not too tough to see why Trinidad is
now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Havana is a city of contradictions. It’s simultaneously one of the most
beautiful and most run down cities in the world. It’s hard to imagine how
things could be any worse, or any better given the Cuba’s political past and
present.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1543, Francisco de Montejo (the nephew of Mérida’s famous Francisco de
Montejo) descended on the ceremonial centre of the Zací (Hawk) Maya, waging war
on the &lt;em&gt;Cupules&lt;/em&gt;, a group of Maya that hadn’t taken kindly to the Spanish
conquistadors. When the battle was done and the town had been razed, he renamed
it Valladolid in honour of the Spanish city of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Somewhere on the old highway between Cancún and Mérida lies Chichen Itzá. The
ruins at this site cover over 15 square kilometres, with &lt;em&gt;El Castillo&lt;/em&gt; alone
taking up 0.4 hectares. At 83 metres in length, the Ball Court is the largest
in Meso-America. The close proximity of the ruins to Cancún and the size of
some of the structures have made these the most famous Mayan ruins in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Between San Cristóbal and Tulúm is a long, empty road. The overnight bus works beautifully for this trip, winding its way through the mountains, jungle and the vast plains of the Yucatán. The only major stop along the way is Escarcega, Campeche. By major, I mean a couple of comida corrida places, a papaya tree, and a dusty bus stop on a long, empty stretch of highway. By six in the morning, we were in Tulúm, a slightly bigger collection of restaurants and bus stops along a long, empty stretch of highway.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;San Cristóbal is, without question, one of the most beautiful towns in Mexico.
It’s also the ideal temperature for visiting Canadians, with the temperature
hovering around 10 °C, and the humidity close to 100% during the daytime in
winter. It’s cold, damp and cloudy. After months of scorching heat and
humidity, I was in heaven. San Cristóbal makes an ideal base from which to do
day-trips to the surrounding villages of San Juan Chamula and
Zinacantán—indigenous villages comprising the Tzotzil and Tzeltal indigenous
groups respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Christmas, we decided to take a trip to the state of Chiapas, about an 8
hour bus ride from Mérida. Although Chiapas has been a somewhat politically
unstable state during the past 10 years, it is also home to some of the most
incredible scenery, archaeological sites and indigenous culture in the
country.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About halfway between Mérida and Progresso lie the ruins of Dzibilchaltún, an
important centre in the ancient world of the Maya. The name means &amp;lsquo;The place

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grabbed a bus north to Progreso to go to the beach. While it was beautiful
weather and the ocean looked great, there were no palm trees on the beach, so
it was impossible to find any shade. We’d heard that in the next town over,
Yucalpetén, there were some great beaches, so we asked around and finally found
a colectivo headed out in that direction. The one we found stopped
by a bathing centre and the town of Chelem. Now right now I’m going to come
straight out and say it: if someone ever tells you a story about the amazing
beaches at Yucalpetén, just back away slowly and do not make any sudden
moves—the person you are talking to has probably escaped from an asylum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Half an hour north of Mérida is the port town of Progreso. Though it’s on the
gulf side of the peninsula, the water is still a beautiful turquoise-blue; it
puts Canadian beaches to shame. On a hot weekend, Progreso makes a fun day
trip. The wind keeps you cool, and as long as you keep ordering drinks, the
food comes free at the palapa huts on the beach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Took a trip a few towns to the east this morning, to Izamal. While Mérida is
known throughout México as the White City, Izamal is referred to as the Yellow
City due to the preponderance of yellow buildings. With a population of 15,000
or so, it’s much quieter than Mérida, and horse-drawn carriages are still used
as transportation by some of its residents. The two big tourist attractions
here are the ruins of Kinich-Kakmó, one of 12 Mayan temples that originally
stood at the site of this town, and the Franciscan Monastery, one of the first
in the New World, built from the stones of the largest Mayan temple in Izamal
after it was torn down by the Conquistadors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Mérida, most people sleep in hammocks. Walk down any residential street and
look in the windows and you’ll see hammocks strung all over the room. What I’m
getting at is that I finally caved in and bought a hammock. Now sit back and
listen, ’cause here’s my advice…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arrived in Cancún on Friday at about 6 pm, took out some money from the bank
machine, and hopped into a colectivo¹ for Ciudad Cancún—the city itself—a
twenty minute drive from the long strip of hotels between the lagoon and the
ocean that the outside world refers to as Cancún. By the time the colectivo got
to the bus station, it was 9 pm, so after checking out the schedule and booking
tickets, there was just enough time to grab some dinner and get some sleep
before heading off to Mérida first thing the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
